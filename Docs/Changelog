~ FC_Suite_Shared Changelog ~

Version 2.3:

- Updated to CB Beta 1.4.6-R0.3
- All plugins have all craftbukkit and minecraft code removed. Only the bukkit API is called. This means my plugins shouldn't break every update anymore. Enjoy.
- List getter has been updated to handle null items properly.
- All plugins have had comments disabled. Tired of people not making tickets to express issues. I'd hate to have to constantly delete peoples comments that should be in tickets so I just disabled them.
- Went through all plugin tickets and updated statuses. Started work on finishing ticket requests. Will have new versions for plugins with them.
- Fixed issue where having an empty tag broke error colors.
- Cleaned up pages for each plugin.
